### RandomUsersDataGenerator

The Random User Generator is a simple web application that allows users to fetch random user data from the Random User API based on specified criteria such as gender and nationality. Users can input their preferences and fetch the desired number of random user profiles.

#### Technologies Used:

- React: The frontend of the application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- CSS: Custom CSS styles are used for layout and styling.
- Fetch API: The Fetch API is used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to the Random User API to fetch user data.
- useState Hook: React's useState hook is used for managing state in functional components.
- Media Queries: CSS media queries are used for making the application responsive across different screen sizes.

#### How to Use

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Install dependencies by running npm install.
- Start the development server by running npm start.
- Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5173 to view the application.

#### Responsive Design

The application is designed to be responsive across different screen sizes using CSS media queries. It adapts its layout and styling to provide an optimal user experience on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

#### Additional Notes

- While Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap are popular frameworks for building responsive web applications, this project opted to use CSS media queries for responsiveness due to its simplicity and suitability for the scope of this application.
- However, Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap are viable alternatives for larger projects or for developers who prefer a framework-based approach to styling and responsiveness.
